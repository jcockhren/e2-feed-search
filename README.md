#SEARCHING for Godot

_SEARCHING for Godot_ is a simple book search application built with AngularJS and Angular Material. Making use of the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/), the app allows users to query books by title and author(s).

_SEARCHING for Godot_ also gives users the ability to preview a given book via the Google Books [Embedded Viewer API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/viewer/developers_guide).

We plan to add Firebase authentication for users to store and retrieve their favorite books and books they'd like to read later.
