#SEARCHING for Godot

*SEARCHING for Godot* is a simple book search application built with AngularJS and Angular Material. Making use of the [Google Books Api](https://developers.google.com/books/), the app allows users to query books by title and author(s).

*SEARCHING for Godot* also gives users the ability to preview a given book via the Google Books [Embedded Viewer API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/viewer/developers_guide).

We plan to add Firebase authentication for users to store and retrieve their favorite books and books they'd like to read later. 

*Feature Assignments:*
 	> Real-time Search Funcionality: Kirk
	 	Front End Layout with Angular Material: Mohamed
		Embedded Viewer API: Teriq
